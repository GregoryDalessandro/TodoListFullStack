# TodoListFullStack

<!-- 1.) Pick a noun. I'm going to use posts for this example.
2.) There needs to be 5 routes:
       GET - /api/posts (Retrieve all posts)
       POST - /api/posts (Create a new post)
       GET - /api/posts/:id (Retrieve a single post by its id)
       PUT - /api/posts/:id (Update a single post by its id)
       DELETE - /api/posts/:id (Delete a single post by its id)
3.) You may use Mongo or MySql. With that, you can choose to write raw queries or use an ORM.
4.) You may write the application using express or raw node. Just don't use any generators or template code. Write everything from the ground up.
5.) Create a React, Angular, or Backbone front-end application that utilizes the API endpoints that you created in the server side.
6.) You should be able to:
    List all of the noun you created.
    Create an instance of the noun you created.
    Retrieve a single noun that you created.
7.) Optionally, you can also allow the app to edit and delete an instance of a noun.
8.) Don't worry about style. Just worry about functionality. -->
